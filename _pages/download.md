# Downloading the game

Please note that the asset files from *Chris Sawyer's Locomotion* are required for OpenLoco to work.
It can be bought on e.g. [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/356430/) or [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/chris_sawyers_locomotion).

The latest version of OpenLoco is v{{page.latest_version}}.<br>
[Changelog](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/releases/v{{page.latest_version}}/)<br>
[Release announcement](https://aaronvangeffen.github.io/OpenLoco-Pages/news/20{{page.latest_version | replace: ".", "/"}}/openloco-v{{page.latest_version}}.html)


## Windows users

The latest release can be downloaded from GitHub using the link below.
Simply unzip the download to your preferred folder, e.g. `C:\Program Files\OpenLoco`.
We recommend putting OpenLoco in a *different* folder than the the original Locomotion files.

	<span style="font-size: 0.75rem; font-weight: normal">(.zip, 32-bits, Intel x86)</span>
</a>

Alternatively, IntelOrca's [OpenLauncher](https://github.com/IntelOrca/OpenLauncher) can be used
to automatically stay up-to-date with the latest OpenLoco release.


## macOS users

As we are still working on reimplementing *Locomotion* in C++, we can only provide 32-bits builds.
For this reason, we cannot provide native builds for macOS. However, the game can be run at full performance
[using Wine](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/wiki/Running-OpenLoco-on-macOS) to run the Windows releases.
Wine taps into [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861), which takes care of translating our Intel builds to Apple Silicon as well.

## Linux and BSD

For Linux and BSD distributions, we currently do not provide any builds. CMake may be used to compile builds for your platform. Please refer to the [README file on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco#linux-1) for details.
