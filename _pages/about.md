The OpenLoco project started in early 2018 by the same group of people behind [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.io).
We are making a modern, open source version of the classic transport simulation game *Chris Sawyer’s Locomotion*
by reimplementing the game fully in C++. As of September 2025, the reimplementation efforts are
[fully completed](https://openloco.io/news/2025/09/openloco-v25.09.html). However, we are still in the process
of reworking the memory model. This means that the game is currently still tied to 32-bit builds only,
but 64-bit builds should be a reality in the very near future.

To retain the look and feel of the original game, we use the original game data for graphics and audio.
This means it is required for players to have installed their own copy of *Locomotion* for OpenLoco to work.
It can be bought on e.g. [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/356430/) or
[GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/chris_sawyers_locomotion).

Curious to see what's been changed compared to the original game? Please refer to our wiki for a list of [changes from Locomotion](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/wiki/Changes-from-Locomotion).
