OpenLoco v25.05 is out! This month, we're introducing new colourful ways to pimp your trains,
made it easier to upgrade stations, and a fair bit of work behind the scenes. For a summary of changes,
please find the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/releases/tag/v25.05) on GitHub.


## Recolour invidiviual vehicles

In Locomotion, players can choose up to two company colours to decorate trains in. This means
trains can either look very colourful, or rather drab, with not much in between. @Spacek set out to change this,
and filed a PR that makes it possible to optionally recolour individual vehicle parts
([#2897](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2897)).
This means you can now customise train colours to your heart's content! Take a look a the video below
for an impression of the possibilities.

## Upgrading station elements directly

[Last month](/news/2025/04/openloco-v25.04.html#a-faster-way-to-build-tracks),
we introduced a new way to quickly build track and station elements. This was received very well,
but immediately sparked new ideas and minor annoyances, as is tradition. The main thing that stood out
to us was how it was cumbersome to upgrade station elements. Basically, in vanilla Locomotion,
players have to remove each of the existing station elements in order to place new ones. No longer!

This month, we're introducing one-click upgrades of existing station elements
([#3087](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3087)). This can be done
in two ways: either by clicking individual station elements, or using the dragging method we
introduced last month.

Often, a picture speaks a thousand words, so have a look at the video below to see it in action!

</video>

Note that replacement costs are calculated. In the video, however, the replacement is free. Why is that?
Well, vanilla Locomotion station objects have their removal costs set to completely fund the
initial construction costs! This means the removal costs and construction costs zero each other out,
making the upgrade free. We think this is not the most realistic, but won't be changing this before
we settle on a new object file format.


## Scenario editor improvements

Time doesn't pass in the scenario editor, so you can take your time building leasurely, right?
Surely, nothing will interfere with this, no? Well, as it turns out, there was a Locomotion bug that
did just that! @LeftofZen identified a line that wasn't taking the editor into account,
which made buildings disappear in scenario editor as well. This has now been addressed
([#3096](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3096)).

Years ago, OpenLoco introduced a Tile Inspector, which is currently mostly used for debugging purposes.
This wasn't available in the scenario editor, though. Until this month, thanks to a patch from
@LeeSpork ([#3097](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3097))!
