OpenLoco v24.04 is out! We're releasing this one a little earlier than you might have expected, little over a week after v24.03.
However, besides quite a bit of behind the scenes work, many bugfixes made it in. We think that warrants a new one!
Let's take a look at what's new.

## Fix PNG heightmaps being mirrored when generating terrain (#2375)

When importing a PNG heightmap, the heightmap data is inferred and stored in a temporary data structure before
processing it into map surface tiles. Turns out we were saving it in the wrong order, leading to a mirrored map.
@LeftOfZen had actually spotted and addressed this when he was implementing it, but an overly-eager reviewer (**\*cough\***)
thought the reversed coordinates were a mistake. Glad we corrected that.

## Fix error messages appearing below the window after cloning a vehicle (#2377)




- Fix: [#2379] Text cursor is not rendering in the right position.
- Fix: [#2380] 'Number of smoothing passes' label is displayed incorrectly.
- Fix: [#2387] Potential crash when a vehicle is deleted while viewing vehicle orders.
- Fix: [#2388] Occasional crash after deleting a vehicle.
- Fix: [#2389] Cargo label and icons overlap in station construction tab.
- Fix: [#2396] Crash when creating a station of greater than 80 tiles.
