OpenLoco v25.02! We have a good chunk of fixes in this release. The main focus was on
completely implementing the town growth function but it didn't quite make the cut. So
that will have to wait for next month.

For a complete summary of changes, please find the
[OpenLoco changelog](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/releases/tag/v25.02) on GitHub.

## Naming Unknowns

Often when implementing something in OpenLoco we can't immediately come up with a good name for a
variable or a constant. This leads to a number of places in the code that refer to `unk` or
`flag`. It's not a great situation as it makes the code base hard to read but it is often the only
way you can do it. @spacek531 and @shusaura85 have spent some time trying to remove some of the unknowns.
There are still more to address and its work anyone can help with.

[#2894](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2894), 
[#2885](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2885), 
[#2872](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2872), 
[#2871](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2871), 
[#2869](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2869)

Some of these changes are in object definitions so you will see the ObjectEditor being updated with
this new knowledge. Hopefully this helps object creators to understand what they are doing.

## Road Placement Game Command

I worked on the road placement game command a few months ago but there was an odd issue with it
that i couldn't find the cause. After leaving it for a few months I found the issue which was that
when placing trams on a road which has a station it would break the order causing the station to
disconnect. With that fixed it is great to finally have this merged. The function is one of the last
very complex game commands! We now only have six main game commands left to implement. Once all of
the commands are complete we will be in a good position to get multiplayer working properly.

## Misc Implementation

@spacek531 decided to have a go at implementing a few vehicle functions. It is great to have some
fresh eyes implementing functions. The functions were all related to adjusting the order/direction
of cars on a train.

[#2949](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2949),
[#2946](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2946)

I finished off the last UI vehicle function (map route interaction) this fixed the issue from last
month that prevented you from being able to place waypoints for boats. Other than that the other
functions were minor setup functions.

[#2943](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2943),
[#2847](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2847),
[#2843](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/2843)

## UI Refactoring

@AaronVanGeffen and @ZehMatt continued there reworking of the UI. We have now managed to port all
of the widgets to a new system. The next stage is moving more of the custom UI code into standard
widgets. Ultimately we should be able to auto layout UI to get a more consistent look and save
headaches whenever changes are need for new features.
