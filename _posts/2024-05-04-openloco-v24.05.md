OpenLoco v24.05 is out! We've made so much _progress_ this month, so we're very excited to share this new release with you all.
Let's dig into the details in this dev log. For a summary of changes, please find the [changelog]() on GitHub.

## Progress bars are back, and better than ever! (#2411, #2440)

One of the charming features of the original Locomotion game was its use of a train for a progress bar.
This has been missing in OpenLoco for a while, but we've brought these progress bars back in this release!
But why were they removed in the first place?

When we reimplemented loading and saving games in C++, we were suprised by how much faster our implementation was,
such that we elected progress bars were unnecessary. However, loading objects can still take a couple of seconds,
especially on saves that pack a bunch.

In addition to progress bars for loading and saving games, the game would use 'native' Windows progress bars
before the game is launched, e.g. to indicate it was checking and indexing its object files. We never got around to
reimplementing these in C++, so these were left alone, and therefore were working like vanilla Locomotion.

We've now reworked the OpenLoco startup procedure, such that the game palette is loaded before objects are checked.
This means we can now enjoy progress bars on the game canvas from very early on! They have also been re-added
for save game loading and saving, as well as landscape generation.

You'd be remiss for thinking rendering progress bars might slow down the game a little, but the opposite is true.
In fact, in adding progress bars, we actually discovered the title scene was being loaded twice! We were able to
narrow down why this is happening, and so sped things up quite considerably!

## Make focus optional for text input widgets (#2416)

Over the past few releases, we've added text input fields to filter items in various lists. For example,
you can now filter objects in the object selection window, and components the vehicle build window.
The only problem was that these fields would always be focused, and therefore broke shortcuts.

Text fields can now be focused by clicking them, and focus can be removed (blurred) by clicking somewhere else.
We expect this will make things more intuitive again.

## Game command reimplementation efforts continue (#2402, #2410, #2439, #2456)

Our long-standing project to reimplement the _game commands_ continues! Basically covering anything a player
can do on a map, a full reimplementation is a requirement for us to add a stable multiplayer mode.

This month, we reimplemented the airplane vehicle placement command, and the commands for removing train stations
and ship ports (docks). This brings the number of implemented game commands to 63 out of 84,
leaving just 21 remaining! Unfortunately, some of the remaining ones are quite long and tricky,
but we're getting there!

## Add last month production column to the industries list (#2426)

New contributor @Sebazzz added a new column to the industries list that displays last month's production.
Below is a screenshot to show it in action. Nice work!

## Rework window storage and increase the window limit (#2419, #2436, #2437, #2438)

Locomotion only reserved space for 12 windows, including toolbars and panels. While this has served us well,
this could sometimes be a bit limiting -- especially on larger displays. This month, we've refactored
the ways windows are kept in memory internally, and increased the storage limit to 64 windows.

Side note: a basic window takes up about 2kB of RAM, not including widgets. This means vanilla was using 24kB of
memory for windows. Thankfully, memory isn't that scarce any more, so we're affording a whopping 128kB now.


## Correct naming and use of ViewportVisibility::heightMarksOnTrack (#2468)

Remember how we [changed the granualarity](https://openloco.io/news/2024/01/openloco-v24.01.html#make-viewport-see-through-flags-more-granular-2231)
of the see-through viewport flags earlier this year? Well, it seems we missed a bit,
which meant the surface height markers were appearing during construction, when track height markers
were meant to be shown!

Interestingly, this is down to a much older mistake in our reimplementation, where we had swapped the
two flags internally. Only now that our implementation is furthering do these mistaken labels start
having an effect!

## Implement tile element insertion (#2415, #2421)

In grid-based games like Locomotions, tile elements comprise everything that is or can be placed on the map.
Oddly enough, though, we hadn't gotten around to reimplementing the function that actually allocates these
elements. Instead, we just continued to use the vanilla implementation. That is no longer needed now.

Last time, we mentioned we were working on [No Locomotion](https://openloco.io/news/2024/04/openloco-v24.04.html#work-on-no-locomotion-executables-2395) versions of the game.
These versions do not call into vanilla Locomotion functions at all, and highlight areas that our code doesn't
cover yet. Tile element insertion was one of these areas. This means we can now actually get in-game!
