OpenLoco v24.05.1 is out! This is a quick hotfix for issues that surfaced while processing malformed objects.
These issues surfaced only now because we [reworked string formatting](https://openloco.io/news/2024/05/openloco-v24.05.html#rework-string-formatting-2461-2464-2469) last month.
Ironically, we hadn't tested the changes with 'bad' objects, so we only found out about the issues
after the release!

For a complete summary of changes, please find the
[changelog](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/releases/tag/v24.05.1) on GitHub.
