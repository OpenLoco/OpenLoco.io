OpenLoco v24.02.1 is out! In 24.02 there was an issue with newly placed train stations where it
would set the height clearance of the station and the track to 0. This would even happen when
hovering a station ghost over the track. With zero clearance on the station and track buildings
could accidentally be built over the top of the track or other unexpected results.

To understand how this mistake slipped in you need to understand how our semi automated replay
verification works. Whenever we add a new bit of code one of the ways we verify we haven't
broken anything is we run the game with a known save and verify that after a known number of
simulation iterations we can produce an identical save file to a reference. We rely on the AI
in the simulation to exercise the code paths of the new code. This isn't foolproof as the AI
does not always perform every action but it happens that the station clearance issue should have
been detected by this method. Unfortunately though in 24.02 we added the train station placement
game command and this command had a number of original AI related bugs that were fixed. So we were
expecting non identical saves and didn't investigate fully why it diverged from the reference.
@memellis has been working on a save game comparison tool which should hopefully be ready for the
release after this, if we had used that tool it is likely this issue would have been noticed.

But anyway issue has now been found and fixed in 24.01.1.
