OpenLoco v24.01.1 is out! In 24.01 we accidentally introduced a bug involving Safe
Structured Exception Handling that caused some crashes when loading save games on
Windows machines. This one was tricky to spot in testing since it only occured on
Windows, and only in release builds, which are not often used when testing in
development. This is fixed in 24.01.1.

As always, please find the
[changelog](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/blob/v24.01.1/CHANGELOG.md)
on GitHub.
