OpenLoco v25.07 is out! This is more a bug fix release for last month, but it does also have a
little more AI implemented. For a summary of changes, please find the
[changelog](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/releases/tag/v25.07) on GitHub.

## Bug Fixes

At the end of last month, I merged a cleanup change that was meant to fix an edge case with
viewports. Unfortunately, it also broke right-click viewport dragging. This has now been fixed.

There was also a bug with the AI, which would cause a crash when the AI was creating an intracity
network. I'm not completely sure what triggers this, but it was a mistake made whilst implementing
the AI.

## Company AI implementation

The Company AI is fully implemented as of today, but it is still under review. In this release, we
have merged the remaining game commands that the AI uses to build. For some reason, the AI has a
combined command for building track/road and stations. The ultimately just call the place
track/road command, followed by the place station command. Ultimately, not too exciting, but
interesting that they exist. Perhaps in the future we could make these commands available to users.
Although, if we did, that would have to correct the cheats the AI has in the commands that let them
place without spending money!
