OpenLoco v23.08.1 is out! This is a bug fix release fixing one major issue.

In v23.06, we introduced our implementation of the Vehicle Order Insert game command.
Unfortunately we forgot to activate our new code until v23.07. Due to this mistake,
testing of the game command was not very robust and we accidentally broke waypoint
vehicle orders. This is fixed in v23.08.1.

Waypoint orders are comprised of a position x, y, z and the track rotation and type.
The x, y, z was correct, but the rotation and type was being corrupted. This meant
that vehicles could never find the track location that the waypoint was associated
with! Luckily it was easy enough to fix, and as the x, y, z was correct, we can infer
the correct rotation and type.

We have noticed though that waypoints in general behave a bit odd. This issue
predates v23.06, though, so we plan to further look into how vehicles are using
them next month.
