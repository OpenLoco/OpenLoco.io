## Features

## Bug Fixes

## OpenGraphics

We've forgotten to continue posting about OpenGraphics updates but they have been happening over the last few months; there are 24 new objects since we last posted in March about this, and they're all by just 2 contributors, @shusaura85 and @glenjimen! Here's a short summary:

### Vehicles
`GRAINHP1.dat`, `GRAINHP2.dat` and `GOODS1.dat` were replaced:

### Road Stations
All 4 vanilla road stations were replaced by OG versions:

![rdstat2](/assets/img/25.09/rdstat2.png)
![rdstat3](/assets/img/25.09/rdstat3.png)
![rdstatl1](/assets/img/25.09/rdstatl1.png)
![rdstatl2](/assets/img/25.09/rdstatl2.png)
![rdstatl3](/assets/img/25.09/rdstatl3.png)
![busstop](/assets/img/25.09/busstop.png)

### Tunnels
`TUNNEL1.dat` and `TUNNEL2.dat` were replaced by `OG_TUNNEL1.dat` and `OG_TUNNEL2.dat` respectively:
![tunnels](/assets/img/25.09/tunnels.png)

### Hill Shapes
The hill shapes object, `HS1.dat`, which controls how the vanilla terrain generation works, was replaced by `OG_HS1.dat`. The new file has many more terrain shapes and much more natural shapes at that, generating some very nice terrain with vanilla generator:

### Streetlights
`SLIGHT1.dat` was replaced by `OG_SLIGHT1.dat`

### Land
All of the land types were replaced by OG versions:

### Cliffs
Land objects have associated cliff objects, so these were also replaced:

### Snow
`SNOW.dat` was replaced by `OG_SNOW.dat`:
