[changelog](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/releases/tag/v25.09) on GitHub.

## Features

## Bug Fixes

## OpenGraphics

We've forgotten to continue posting about OpenGraphics updates but they have been happening over the last few months; there are 24 new objects since we last posted in March about this, and they're all by just 2 contributors, @shusaura85 and @glenjimen! Here's a short summary:

### Vehicles
@glenjimen figured out how to set up a modern Blender workflow and started generated some gorgeous vehicles, which all have twice the rotation frames as the vanilla objects so the look extra smooth in-game. I've highlighted the new vehicles/sprites in red in the below image. Starting at the bottom, we have `OG_GRAINHP2.dat` replacing `GRAINHP2.dat`, then `OG_GRAINPH1.dat` replacing `GRAINHP2.dat` and finally in the top right, we have `OG_GOODS1.dat` replacing `GOODS1.dat`:

### Road Stations
@shusaura85 replaced all of the vanilla road stations as well as the bus stop with OG versions:

### Tunnels
@shusaura85 replaced `TUNNEL1.dat` and `TUNNEL2.dat` with `OG_TUNNEL1.dat` and `OG_TUNNEL2.dat` respectively. Vanilla shown on the left, OG on the right:

### Hill Shapes
The hill shapes object, `HS1.dat`, which controls how the vanilla terrain generation works, was replaced with `OG_HS1.dat` by @shusaura85. The new file has many more terrain shapes and much more natural shapes at that, generating some very nice terrain with vanilla generator. Vanilla is shown on top here, and the OG replacement on the bottom:

### Streetlights
@shusaura85 replaced `SLIGHT1.dat` was replaced with `OG_SLIGHT1.dat`

### Cliffs
Land objects have associated cliff objects, so these were also replaced by @shusaura85:
