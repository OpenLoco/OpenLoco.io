OpenLoco v25.11 is out! This release introduces some neat quality-of-life features to the game,
as well as several bug fixes. More importantly, we continue our efforts of reworking the game's
memory space. Let's dig in!

## Prevent accidental cargo removal

New contributor @luciditee got back into the game recently, and fell into the age-old trap where
changing vehicles would remove all of their cargo. Never again, they declared. And so,
[#3323](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3323) was filed, which adds a confirmation dialog
to the vehicle component tab. This means changing vehicle/wagon order now prompts for confirmation
*if* the vehicle is currently transporting cargo. A similar prompt is displayed when refitting a vehicle
to transport different cargo, as can be seen in the screenshot below.

## Rework remaining legacy config into modern config

Since we started work on OpenLoco, the game has always had two config files: one for the
'new' options OpenLoco introduces, and one for the vanilla game's settings.
Over time, some variables were moved over (e.g. shortcuts), but it was generally
a matter of two worlds.

The main reason for this was that we were still dealing with vanilla game functions that we hadn't yet
reimplemented in C++. These functions were still expecting to be able to read from the old
config location! As of [v25.09](/news/2025/09/openloco-v25.09.html), all functions have been
reimplemented, though. To be fully implemented, we have to move on config-wise as well.

As of [#3323](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3323), all config variables are now
stored in the `openloco.yml` file. You can find this in the OpenLoco folder in your user profile
(in Windows, this is `AppData\Roaming`). Go take a peek!

## Show AI allocations as regular ghost elements

Despite their flaws, some people like playing the game with AI companies enabled. However, sometimes,
there is considerable delay between the AI planning a route and actually building it. In the mean time,
the planned route is reserved using invisible elements. This may be frustrating, as players aren't
allowed to build over them.

In [#3270](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3270), a new option
was introduced to make these planned routes visible as 'ghost' elements, much like how players'
construction tiles show up. Note that this option is off by default, as we consider it a bit of a cheat.
Below are a few screenshots of what it looks like.

## Merge sound and music tabs in options window

This month, @LeeSpork continues their quest of making the OpenLoco jukebox experience as smooth as possible.
A longstanding request was to make the music options, and therefore the music volume settings, accessible
from the title screen. In [#3326](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3326), the tab was revealed
on the title screen. It was quickly followed by [#3352](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3352), though,
which merges the relatively short 'sound' tab into the 'music' tab, which is now called 'audio'.
There are already plans for separate volume controls, e.g. for music and sound effects, so watch this space!

## Disallow interfering with competitor's roads and road stations

@LeeSpork discovered that it was possible for players to interfere with competitor's roads.
They quickly filed patches to prevent competitor road removal ([#3335](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3335)),
as well as competitor road station replacement ([#3336](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3336)).
Nice catch!

## Add platform and arch to title screen

As we previously mentioned, as of [v25.09](/news/2025/09/openloco-v25.09.html), all game functions have been
reimplemented in C++. We're not *quite* at the point where we can make fully working 64-bit builds
([#3288](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3288)),
we realised this would be a good time to add platform and processor/arch information to the title screen.
With [#3328](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3328) merged,
you can now find this info in the lower-left corner, just below the usual version information.

## Catch FileStream exceptions when loading from CLI

This may be a bit obscure, but have you ever tried to load OpenLoco with command-line arguments?
As long as you're passing arguments the game understands, with files that exist, the game
is happy to process everything. If it doesn't understand an argument, the game assumes you're
trying to load a file, though. If this 'file' doesn't exist, the game would throw a `FileStream`
exception, but not catch it, crashing the game. This is now mitigated by
[#3363](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3363), letting the game instead
just log a warning to the console.

## Rename a bunch of things

Over the course of the literal *years* we've worked on OpenLoco, some parts of the code base
have basically not been touched since they were initially implemented. With the benefit of
understanding the code base better, some things could be named better, in retrospect.
This month, some community members expressed interest in understanding the path/signal/routing
functions, for example. To make them easier to understand, @duncanspumpkin has renamed
a bunch of variables ([#3350](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3350)).

Following this example, @AaronVanGeffen set out to rename several `sub_` functions, that had
not received a new name in the reverse engineering process
([#3359](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3359)).
Similarly, one of the first game commands we implemented was the `LoadSaveQuitGame`
game command. We now understand this better, leading us to rename its arguments
([#3367](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pull/3367)).
