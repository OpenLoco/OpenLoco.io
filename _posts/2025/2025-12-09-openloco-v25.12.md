OpenLoco v25.12 is out! This release marks a major milestone for the project.
We completed the C++ reimplemention in [v25.09](/news/2025/09/openloco-v25.09.html) a few months ago,
but were still dependent on vanilla memory space. This month, we celebrate the complete
reworking of the memory space as well.

In short, this means the game can now be compiled *natively* for all platforms.
This means this month's release is available in **64-bits** architecture for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
You can expect builds to be faster, and much easier to port to new operating systems.
Of course, we are extremely happy with this result, and what this means for future possibilities.

In this blog post, we'll look back on how the memory space was reworked,
as well as some quality-of-life changes that were merged this month,
and the progress the OpenGraphics project has seen. Let's get going.

## Big loco_global integration extravaganza

Until this month, we still mirrored the vanilla game's approached to *memory space* in most places.
As often talked about in previous blogs, this was done with `loco_global` instances.
Last month, we reported on the progress of reworking this, going from
342 `loco_globals` in the v25.10 release to just 157 in v25.11...
Remarkably, this month takes us down to **0** `loco_globals` — yes, zero!
It was a massive team effort, but it's paid off massively, making 64-bit builds finally possible.

We usually list PR numbers in our dev log sections, however there were 46 PRs just for
`loco_global` removal this month! If you're curious to see what such PRs look like,
you can find them on GitHub. Follow
[this link](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3Av25.12+interop+OR+global+OR+loco_globals)
for a list of the relevant PRs.

To illustrate the growth and removal of `loco_global` instances from the project's inception to now,
please take a look at the graph below. As more of the game became reimplemented, more memory had to be
shared between vanilla functions and our C++ functions, thus increasing the number of `loco_global`s.
Only once all vanilla systems had been reimplemented could the relevant memory be fully integrated.
Clearly, the last few months saw the final stretches of this effort.
