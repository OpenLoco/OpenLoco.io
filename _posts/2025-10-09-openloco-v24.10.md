OpenLoco v25.10 is out! This release contains fixes for crashes that could occur when secondary viewports
moving into view, such as with the news window. In the background, work on separating our codebase from the
vanilla game's memory space also continues.

## Revert drawing widgets in relative positions (#3305)

In previous releases, we've been reworking how the in-game windows and their widgets are organised.
Notably, this May, we changed how these are drawn. Unfortunately, this has turned out buggier than
we had originally expected. While we made several attempts to fix the issues, they have proven
non-trivial to address.

As it stands now, it seems we were a bit too eager for these changes to be made, while the
drawing engine isn't as separated as much as we would like. We therefore made the decision
to revert the changes from earlier this year, and work on refactors to make them actually meet
underlying assumptions in the —hopefully— near future.

## Continued `loco_global` integration efforts

As of last month, we have finished reimplementing all C++ functions, but our reimplementation still refers
to vanilla memory space in several places. As often talked about in previous blogs, this is done with
`loco_global` instances. When the project started off, these were introduced as a high-level wrapper
around a particular memory address. Such wrappers allowed us to start using strongly typed C++
from the get go, instead of having to rely on raw addresses for longer.

Many of the remaining `loco_globals` can be 'integrated' into static memory space as-is. However,
extra care needs to be taken when more than one compilation unit refers to the same bit of memory space.
For example, certain windows remember where the last 'ghost' element was placed. However, some game commands
update those very same memory addresses. In such instances, this needs to be reworked, so there is only
one real memory owner.

At the time of writing this blog post, 351 `loco_global` instances remain, across 95 files.
Hopefully, by the time the next release turns around, we will have made ample progress in rewriting them.
